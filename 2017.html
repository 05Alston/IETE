                <p>The various options and tools available in the software were explained which was followed by the explanation of the finding and placing the components in the workspace and connecting it with the wires (net). The layout for a Voltage divider BJT amplifier circuit with bypassed emitter was explained and designed. The part of plotting the frequency response for the same circuit using the frequency response option available in the graph mode of the software was explained. Then, a digital circuit showing interfacing of priority encoder and 7 segment display was simulated. The participants were then asked to simulate a 4:1 MUX circuit on the simulator.The demonstration for printing the layout designed on the software on the copper clad board using heat transfer technique was given.</p>
